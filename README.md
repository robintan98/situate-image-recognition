Extension of Situate Image Recognition to Handshakes
Portland State University

==========================================================
-=: Description:
  The main MATLAB files I wrote as an AI research intern at Portland State University on a National Science Foundation-sponsored project on image recognition. As a high school research intern, I explored and expanded upon the Situate image recognition algorithm to handshake identification. Through this internship, I gained practical experience working with convolutional neural networks and writing machine learning algorithms from k-means clustering and principal component analysis to coding my own perceptron.
